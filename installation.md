## Installing the prerequisites
For a full AMUSE installation, you will need to install some further dependencies that can be installed via your package manager - e.g. apt or yum on Linux; macports or homebrew on macOS.

### Ubuntu

You can choose between openmpi and mpich as desired, both work with AMUSE. Please do not install both!
In the examples below we choose GCC-7 as the compiler, but more recent versions of GCC will also work.

- For openmpi:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential gfortran python-dev \
  libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin \
  libgsl-dev cmake libfftw3-3 libfftw3-dev \
  libgmp3-dev libmpfr6 libmpfr-dev \
  libhdf5-serial-dev hdf5-tools \
  git
```

- For mpich:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential gfortran python-dev \
  mpich libmpich-dev \
  libgsl-dev cmake libfftw3-3 libfftw3-dev \
  libgmp3-dev libmpfr6 libmpfr-dev \
  libhdf5-serial-dev hdf5-tools \
  git
```

### macOS

On macOS, you will first need to install Xcode. You can do so via the app store.

In this section we assume a default macOS installation (up to Mojave) with MacPorts, but other methods (such as Homebrew) will also work.

You can choose between openmpi and mpich as desired, both work with AMUSE. 
Please make sure to set the compilers installed here as default, as it will greatly simplify things later on.
In the examples below we choose GCC-7 as the compiler, but more recent versions of GCC will also work.

- For openmpi:

```bash
sudo port install gcc7 openmpi-gcc7 hdf5 gsl cmake gmp mpfr fftw-3 +gcc7
sudo port install python27 py27-virtualenv
sudo port select --set mpi openmpi-gcc7-fortran
sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc7
sudo port select --set python2 python27
sudo port select --set virtualenv virtualenv27
```

- For mpich:

```bash
sudo port install gcc7 mpich-gcc7 hdf5 gsl cmake gmp mpfr fftw-3 +gcc7
sudo port install python27 py27-virtualenv
sudo port select --set mpi mpich-gcc7
sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc7
sudo port select --set python2 python27
sudo port select --set virtualenv virtualenv27
```


## Installing AMUSE

After installing the prerequisites, you can install AMUSE.
Optionally, first create a virtual environment to install AMUSE and other desired Python packages in.
This ensures that you don’t need root privileges and that your AMUSE environment is isolated from other system-installed packages.

To create the virtual environment, do (from a desired directory):

```bash
virtualenv Amuse-env
```
When the environment is created, you can activate it with:

```bash
. Amuse-env/bin/activate
```
You may want to make an alias for this, e.g.:

```bash
alias amuse-env='. ~/virtualenvironments/Amuse-env/bin/activate'
```
From this point, your prompt will have ‘Amuse-env’ in front of it, so you will always know when you’re in this virtual environment.

Now you can use pip to install the prerequisite python modules for AMUSE:

```bash
pip install numpy nose docutils mpi4py h5py
```
Probably, you’ll want to install these Python modules too:

```bash
pip install scipy astropy jupyter pandas seaborn
```
Now we can finally install AMUSE itself.
This is done easiest via pip:
```bash
pip install amuse
```
If you only require a subset of AMUSE, you can install any of the individual packages as such:
```bash
pip install amuse-framework
pip install amuse-$(community_code_name)
```
